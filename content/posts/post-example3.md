# Basics of Markdown

Markdown is the most popular markup language that can be used to format documents. It can be used to create _websites_,_ebooks_,_email_,_chats in discussions forums_.

## Topics

1. Paragraphs

  MD expects a full line space to show texts in a different line else it joins text in the same line.

2. Text decorations

  MD can write **bold** texts, ~~italiic~~ _italic_ texts

3. Headings No of #'s represent the type of heading. Github will automatically add id's to headings, so the text will be automatically linked.
